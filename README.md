### Re-editioning an old prayer book



This project is a WIP. This project seeks to explore how cultural memory is intertwined with documentation. The images produced using this code are meant to be included as illustrations in a personal re-editioning of a prayer book used throughout the Catholic households in Guam. The images are intended to come into dialogue with the CHamoru Novena, which is considered one of the first published texts in the CHamoru language.



#### Databending



Databending is a unique way to intentionally corrupt and change images. The project uses Audacity and the Audacity API to "data-bend" raw image files using audio tools. 





#### Novena



Due to colonial pressures in the 20th century, CHamoru language texts were very late to come into existence. As the American military pressured locals to assimilate, generations of CHamorus lost the language in daily use. The novena, a catholic prayer book, was published in CHamoru in 1928. By the end of the century, it had found it's way into almost every household in Guam, which to me, is a manifestation of complete cultural assimilation into Catholicism.



The book recounts the days leading up to the birth of Jesus. It holds themes of motherhood, family, and reciprocity which are key elements of CHamoru culture. At the same time, it contains diction and story elements that embolden obedience, subservience and subjugation under higher powers. 



By incorporating data-bent images with the story presented in the Novena, I hope to reconcile which ideas we should keep and which we should discard from this common household artifact.
